# What is Sandbox?

Sandbox is a set of tools that make modding Minecraft easier from both a newcomer and an experienced developer perspective.

With Sandbox you have the full power of both client-side and server-side modding, without having to ask your users to install anything except the implementation of their choice.

Sandbox is composed primarily of A version agnostic API that developers can use to create addons. It is designed to be stable across Minecraft versions. For more information, refer to the [Release Policy](release-policy.md) page.

To use a SandboxAPI addon in the game you'd have to install one of the implementations designed for it, different implementations differ in many ways and you should check what you need to decide which implementation you should use in the [Feature Parity](../implementations/feature-parity.md) page.
