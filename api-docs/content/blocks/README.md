# Blocks

### Creating a Block

For simple blocks a custom implementation need not be applied, you're able to construct BaseBlock and apply a custom Settings object to that to configure fine details about the block's properties.

* `material` - 
* `hardness` -
* `resistance` -
* `slipperiness` -
* `velocity` -
* `jumpVelocity` - 
* `luminance` - Luminance modifies the light level emitted from the block for a range of 0 to 15 with 0 being no light emitted.
* `opacity` - Opacity modifies the amount of light that can pass through the block in a range of 0 to 15 with 0 being all light passes through.
