# Silica FAQ

## What is Silica?

Silica is a ground-up rewrite of Minecraft's server and client, written in Kotlin using the Sandbox API.

## Why are you rewriting Minecraft?

Minecraft as it currently exists was not designed for where the modded ecosystem has pushed it, our goal is to create a more optimised and well suited home for modded content to be more performant.

## What makes Silica better?

Silica uses modern techniques such as threads and coroutines to allow it to make use of all of more CPU cores and get more out of the hardware its on. It's also open source and welcome contributions to improve it
